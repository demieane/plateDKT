TO DO:

0. Find an alternative mesh generator (adaptive mesh in .c)?
1. shepard_interp_2d in cuda already available?

1. FEM in single or double precision? Prepare a version that has both on switch [DONE]
2. Eigen-analysis using lapack functions [DONE]
3. Very simple CUDA version of the FEM code (only the necessary stuff) [PENDING..]
4. Free structures [DONE]

5. Time integration (give an animation back to Matlab)
    [] Rayleigh damping function (in the end)
    [x] Fglob re-calculate
    [] Crank-nicolson time integration func
    [x] The time-varying forcing data need to be supplemented for each time step, 
        to work with an example I can either provide the distributed load at each time instance
        or add ficticiously a cos(wt) amplitude for testing. 
    [] solution structure & solution retriever func
