BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) is a set of definitions of common operations 
on vectors and (dense) matrices. LAPACK is the Linear Algebra Package 
that builds on BLAS and that offers numerical algorithms such as 
linear system solving and eigenvalue calculations.

BLAS is a collection of low-level matrix and vector arithmetic operations
 (“multiply a vector by a scalar”, “multiply two matrices and add to a third matrix”, etc ...).

LAPACK is a collection of higher-level linear algebra operations. 
Things like matrix factorizations (LU, LLt, QR, SVD, Schur, etc) that are used to do things
like “find the eigenvalues of a matrix”, or “find the singular values of a matrix”, 
or “solve a linear system”. LAPACK is built on top of the BLAS; many users of LAPACK 
only use the LAPACK interfaces and never need to be aware of the BLAS at all. 
LAPACK is generally compiled separately from the BLAS, and can use whatever 
highly-optimized BLAS implementation you have available.

ATLAS is a portable reasonably good implementation of the BLAS 
interfaces, that also implements a few of the most commonly used LAPACK operations.
